# AlzAboutMe
AlzAbout.Me: A web application that helps you write, save and remember The Story of Your Life, so you can continue to help and inspire others in life and love by creating — and sharing — deeply personal, touching and comforting portraits of happiness for your own peace of mind, so you can better get a good night sleep.<br /><br />
The project is for Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles http://www.alzgla.org/, a not-for-profit organization that provides care and support for families affected by Alzheimer's in the Greater Los Angeles Area.
